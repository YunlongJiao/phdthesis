First and foremost, I would like to thank Jean-Philippe Vert for being an inspiring advisor and a supportive supervisor, for having welcomed me into CBIO with an incredible funding opportunity, for sharing his experience and ideas with me that have both consciously and unconsciously shaped my academic and communication skills, for setting an excellent example of a researcher with contagious enthusiasm and a group leader with motivational leadership, and lastly for that I would simply never have completed the work in the present thesis without his dedication.


During my PhD, I was very fortunately offered the opportunity to have worked with Joaquin Dopazo, who proposed and led one of my doctoral projects and mentored me with encouragement and inspiration during my stay at CIPF, and Stefan Kobel, who patiently trained my presentation skillfulness and enriched my knowledge in biochemistry during my stay at Roche; both mentors have been huge influences to me for which I cannot express enough gratitude. Many other people have contributed, directly or indirectly, to the work presented in this thesis, and I would like to thank them: Anna Korba, Eric Sibony... Marta Hidalgo, Cankut \c{C}ubuk, Alicia Amadoz, Jos\'{e} Carbonell-Caballero... Elsa Bernard, Erwan Scornet, V\'{e}ronique Stoven, Thomas Walter... Fabian Heinemann, Sven Dahlmanns... Vincent Brunet...


I would also like to thank my thesis review committee, Risi Kondor and St\'{e}phan Cl\'{e}men\c{c}on, for their time, interest and helpful comments, and other members on my oral defense committee, R\'{e}mi Gribonval, for their time, participation and insightful questions.

Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancy for women and breast cancer prognosis is currently one of the leading problems of great interest. The advent of high-throughput platforms for gene expression profiling motivates the popular trend of using molecular biomarkers for clinical decision making regarding prognosis improvement assisting therapeutic strategies. It has been widely recognized as a very promising yet challenging problem to extract potentially valuable information from genomic data. The relatively small number of clinical samples, the inherent measurement noise in high-throughput experimental data and the heterogeneity across patients make it demanding to detect reliable biomarkers.

%Sorry I won't write your PhD here ;) This small text just to mention that this style supports writing with accents such as in french words (thèse, définir, ...). Also I put here a simple way to include an image. This is standard latex. For pdflatex compilation, the extension of the images is jpg. For latex compilation, this is ps or eps. The base folder containing images is set in formatAndDefs.tex, as well as the default extensions added to the image names.

The thesis work has been driven typically by the development and investigation of machine learning methods in genomic data analysis for improved breast cancer prognosis and for detecting robust genomic signatures related to cancer prognosis. Towards these goals, two directions in terms of methodologies have been explored for supervised survival prediction and structured feature selection, based on rank-based and network-guided approaches respectively, in the present thesis to address the computational challenges in genomic data analysis for cancer prognosis.
